# Musical CSPs in Python

This is a project to examine the use of generating music and harmony using CSPs and Python. 
This program uses the Generalized Arc Consistency algorithm with Domain Splitting to find a 
voicing for a given harmony that does not violate the rules of Counterpoint. A sample can
be found at https://z.umn.edu/aiharmonizersample1.
