# Musical CSPs in Python

This is a project to examine the use of generating music and harmony using CSPs and Python.

Constraints to implement yet:

- Leading tone resolves up
- 7th resolves down
- No voice crossing
- No leaps larger than a 5th (or 8th for bass)
- All notes in triad and seventh chord (maybe exclude the fifth)
